# anagramChecker

Requirements:
It's test java program that checks if two texts are anagrams of each other. 
Anagram definition was taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram.

As a given requirement, I considered to accept text with numbers and special cherecters, but they are ignored during comparison.
UI is a simple JSP page, it has 2 inputs (not blank and less than 200 symbols, at least one letter considred as word) and click‚Äù Submit" button. Result will be shown below the form.
